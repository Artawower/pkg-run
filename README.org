2. Extract all scripts from the scripts section
3. Present them in a completion interface
4. Detect the package manager based on lock files (pnpm-lock.yaml, bun.lockb, or default to npm)
5. Run the selected script using Emacs compilation mode

* Customization
**** Default package manager
If you want to override automatic detection:
=(setq pkg-run-default-package-manager 'pnpm)=

Available options:
- =nil= - Auto-detect (default)
- ='pnpm= - Use pnpm
- ='bun= - Use bun
- ='npm= - Use npm

* Package manager detection
The package automatically detects the package manager based on lock files:
- =pnpm-lock.yaml= → pnpm
- =bun.lockb= → bun
- Otherwise → npm (default)
